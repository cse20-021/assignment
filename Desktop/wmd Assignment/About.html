   <br><p>Spring (March - May)<br>
    A popular time of the year to visit the French capital, spring in Paris starts out chilly with daily highs of around 54°F (12°C) in March. By May the weather warms up to a very pleasant 68°F (20°C) - perfect for spending the day exploring the city’s beautiful gardens and parks.Nights remain pretty cold throughout the season and don’t be surprised by light showers. Always carry a lightweight jacket with a zip on hood just in case nature takes it cause.<br>
    
    <br>Summer (June - August)<br>
    This is the height of tourist season in Paris, and it is accompanied by matching high temperatures. Expect daily highs of at least 83°F (25°C), accompanied by brisk nights of around 55°F (13°C). As luck would have it, this the driest part of the year - sunglasses are an absolute must! While these temperatures may not seem very high to some, keep in mind that humidity can make Paris feel warmer. My favorite idea is to picnic in front of the Eiffel Tower on the Champs de Mars Gardens while the sunlight lights up your day until 10pm! We recommend the Collioure apartment nearby, a great price with an Eiffel view! When you’re out and about on a sunny summer day in the French capital, be sure to keep a water bottle with you to stay hydrated.<br>
    
    <br>Autumn (September - December)<br>
    With locals back from their summer holidays and thinner tourist crowds, there’s a great buzz around Paris in autumn. Temperatures cool down quite a bit beginning in October, but if you’ve packed a jacket, autumn is the perfect time to enjoy long walks through stunning neighborhoods and a stroll along the Seine River. Be prepared for the occasional chilly rain shower and bit of wind. Daily highs range anywhere from 46°F (8°C) to 62°F (17°C).<br>
    
    <br>Winter (January - February)<br>
    Despite shorter days and decidedly wetter weather, winter is truly a special time of year in Paris. Staying true to its City of Light moniker, the French capital sparkles under the glow of festive holiday lights. Enhanced by the occasional dusting of snow, visiting Paris in winter can be a magical experience. Expect daily highs of 46°F (8°C) and night time temperatures near freezing.<br></p>
  
    <br>       <h1>Population of the Parisians</h1>
    <p>The City of Lights is a famous capital that covers approximately 105 squared kilometers of the French land. Within those 105 squared kilometers is a large amount of 1,079,000 people that reside there.<br></p>
